        communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and
        when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. </p>
    <p>We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What
        data we store, we'll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as
        unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>

        from Google Analytics is used to improve our website and better understand our visitors. Google Analytics
